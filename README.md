# SPA-Cars_Final_Exam
 Final exam project for SoftUni. I implemented a SPA to create and manage vehicle records. The application allows visitors to do different types of actions like register, login, and search for different information, create, edit, or delete their own car record information. I was provided with a server and a HTML&amp;CSS structure by the university.
